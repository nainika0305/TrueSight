**TrueSight** is an AI-powered deepfake detection system designed to verify the authenticity of images in real-time. It leverages a pretrained Xception model with explainability via Grad-CAM and image metadata (EXIF) analysis. The system is being built as a web-based app and Chrome extension backed by a FastAPI API.
